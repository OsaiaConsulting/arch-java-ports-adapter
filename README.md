Ports & Adapter (Hexagonal) Architecture in Java – Todo App

This repository demonstrates the Ports & Adapter (Hexagonal) Architecture in Java with a simple Todo App. It follows a clean architecture approach, separating core business logic from external dependencies to ensure maintainability and flexibility.

Key Features:
	•	Structured into domain, application, and infrastructure layers
	•	Uses Spring Boot for dependency injection and REST API
	•	H2 Database for persistence, easily replaceable with other databases

This project is ideal for understanding Hexagonal Architecture and building scalable, maintainable applications.
